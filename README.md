// Dear programmer:
// When I wrote this code, only god and
// I knew how it worked.
// Now, only god knows it!
//
// Therefore, if you are trying to optimize
// this routine and it fails (most surely),
// please increase this counter as a 
// warning for the next person:
//
// total_hours_wasted_here = 254
